# Instructions for Usage
1. 'eeg-final.ipynb' contains the code for training and validating the EEGLab model. The hyperparamters can be changed in the file.
2. 'real_time_monitoring.py' contains code for reading data from the MUSE monitor, and predicting glucose values in real time.
3. 'sleeping_stages.py' contains code for classifying the sleeping stages from the MUSE data.
4. We also attempted to use an SVM to classify the data, and the SVM folder contains code for this.
